Data Sources

I attempted to use ProPublica as my main data source for an API but the Datbase was moved.
I had to pivot and use FEC Campaign Data API.
I also used a CSV that covered campaign contributions from Telecom Companines that were affected by the net neutrality vote.

The Process

I took data from the FEC API and converted into a pandas data frame, extracting the 'results' column.
I was able to extract campaign finance data numbers, but had issues during the pivot of attaining the candidates id.
I loaded it into dataframes and then pushed it into mongoDB.

I had hoped to understand the data a bit better and seperate by party, campaign amounts and votes for certain bills,
but was unable to complete the task in time.
